//Consider an even length array S of numbers from 1 to M. 
//We will call this array good if it can be split into any number of contiguous subsequences of even length, each one being a palindrome.
//Given N and M, count the number of good arrays of length N with numbers from 1 to M 
//Input
//The first line of input contains two integers N and M.
//Output
//Output a single integer, the number of good arrays of length N with numbers from 1 to M.
//Constraints
//N is even
//1≤N≤1000
//1≤M≤1000
//Sample Input
//4 2
//Sample Output
//6
//Explanation
//The following arrays are good:
//[1,1,2,2]
//[1,2,1,2]
//[1,2,2,1]
//[2,1,1,2]
//[2,1,2,1]
//[2,2,1,1]
